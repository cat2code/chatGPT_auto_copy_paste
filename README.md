# chatGPT_auto_copy_paste
Simple implementation of a tool retrieving an answer from Open AI's chatGPT and pasting it in marked area in Mac OS. Use this to much faster retrieve an answer by chatGPT-3 while doing work in Mac OS. It feels like a native feature of the OS. 

Using: BetterTouchTool (free 45 day trial), Javascript, Open AI API with chatGPT-3 (automatic payment per use).

Further work (as of now):
* Implement possibility for conversation 
* Implement some kind of loading indicator
