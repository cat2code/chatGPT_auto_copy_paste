# How to install copy paster

Reminder: this copy paster solution is **not free**, though it has very low costs. You cannot avoid having to pay using chatGPT-3 this way either way. 

**Set up Open AI and get API**
-> Make an account at Open AI
-> Add payment method to your Open AI account.
NOTE: It wont work otherwise. Using chatGPT this way is not free and it costs a (very) small amount for every use. If I use it a lot i would expect to spend 0.1-0.2 Â¢ a day. 
-> Get API here and **save it!**: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
-> Done for now!

**Install BetterTouchTool:** https://folivora.ai/ (has a 45 day trial)

In newly installed BTT:
-> go to "configure"
-> choose "keyboard shortcuts"
-> choose "Transform & Replace Selection With Java Script"
-> copy and paste the Java Script code in this repo in text box "Clipboard Transformer Function"
-> **Enter your saved API from Open AI instructions above**
-> Test if it is working with the "Example Input" text box
-> Under the text box "Result" there should be an answer from chatGPT-3. If it says "Error" something went wrong, for example if you have not set up a payment method.


Have fun! The future is now.

Write a short poem about the AI future 

The future of AI is here,
A world of automation so clear,
Where robots and machines do the work,
And humans can take a break and just lurk.

The possibilities are endless and grand,
A world of convenience at our command,
Where technology can make life so much easier,
And the future of AI is here to please us.
